Use ProjectorSwitch with the Zoom conferencing application on Windows to move the second Zoom window to a designated monitor and back to its original position.

Download ProjectorSwitch.exe into a folder and run it. Select the target monitor from the drop-down list and click the Toggle button to move the Zoom window to the chosen monitor. Click the button again to move it back.

The application stores its settings in the settings.ini file in the same folder as the executable file, so make sure you have write permissions to the folder.
